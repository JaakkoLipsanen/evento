React front-end for evento, a project that I developed with [**Jaakko**](https://github.com/JaakkoLipsanen). It's basically a social media website for announcing and participating to events, such as concerts, sports events, group meetings etc. 

We developed this for an university course and while we are happy with the result, we have a lot of ideas on how to extend the project from it's current state (some of the ideas are in the issues section of this project). However, we mostly made this project as a learning experience and we have no plans to make this into an actual product :)
